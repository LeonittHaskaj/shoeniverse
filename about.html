                    Shoeniverse is a global retail experience founded in 2015 by Leonit Haskaj and Vloriat Berisha who turned a sneaker collection into a global retail company.
                    The avid collectors, who both were working in the sports and lifestyle categories in Prishtina, saw a hole in the Kosovo retail marketâ€”specifically one for sneaker consumers that had niche tastes. In the late '90s, there was no alternative to the big retail chains dominating Prishtina, and after a trip to New York City that yielded both inspiration and the acquisition of some exclusive products that Kosovo had yet to see, shoeniverse was born.
                    shoeniverse first opened its doors on March 26th, 2015 in Prishtina with the launch of the website www.shoeniverse.com May 2015.
                    Two decades later, shoeniverse celebrates 20 years in the game and is still located on Prishtina, on Prishtina's and has since opened stores in Berlin, London, Paris, New York City (including the SNS Bar) Los Angeles and Tokyo. What started as a 2-man operation has since grown to be a global sneaker experience with 200+ employees. Each store is designed by Swedish Architect Jenny Askenfors of Bofink Design Studio and incorporates the identity of the city and SNS.

                        Well-known throughout the world, shoeniverse is the store that put Kosovo on the sneaker map and is now on the forefront of footwear retailing. Widely known for always carrying carefully selected items hard to come by such as adidas YEEZY, Nike x Off-White, NikeLab collections, adidas Consortium, SNS stays true to the classics with a massive assortment of Nike Air Force 1's, Nike Air Max 1's, Converse, adidas Stan Smith's, Puma Suedes, New Balance amongst many others.
                        After four years of running their Prishtina-based store, Leonit and Vloriat were given their first sneaker collaboration in 2003, a Puma Basket quickly followed in 2004 by a partnership with New Balance. Later on, SNS had several more opportunities to work with the biggest footwear brands in the world.                    </p>
